Notes on Binaural Synthesis

The best sounding coeffs for front speakers in the 1057 set are:
#define FRONT_FILE L"C:\\tmp\\BinauralDemos\\IRC_1058\\RAW\\WAV\\IRC_1057_C\\IRC_1057_C_R0195_T015_P015.wav"
These were compensated as can be seen in the FSpectrum include files. Note the T015_P000 version has a
nastier uncompensated frequency response and was harder to compensate well, so with with P015 ones.

Note that compensation is a little tricky in that the two channels are summing at lower frequencies,
making it prone to have too much bass response. Thus the final composite compensation curve was manipulated
both by eye and by ear for appropriate bass response.

The DC gain correction corrects both sets of coeffs to yield the targeted gain. Setting for a composite
gain of 1.0 was pulling up the curve too much above 0hz, so it was tweaked done to 0.5 composite.

When using these trimmed IRC files, a 96 coeff length seems ok.
#define FRONT_FILE L"C:\\tmp\\BinauralDemos\\IRC_1057\\RAW\\WAV\\IRC_1057_R\\IRC_1057_R_R0195_T015_P000TrimComp2DC.wav"
#define REAR_FILE  L"C:\\tmp\\BinauralDemos\\IRC_1057\\RAW\\WAV\\IRC_1057_R\\IRC_1057_R_R0195_T165_P000TrimComp2.wav"
#define SIDE_FILE  L"C:\\tmp\\BinauralDemos\\IRC_1057\\RAW\\WAV\\IRC_1057_R\\IRC_1057_R_R0195_T090_P000TrimComp2.wav"

Notes on 44.1 to 48 sample rate conversion - SoundForge conversion seems to work ok based on spectrums,
but is introducing some additional gain, approximately .817dB or a gain of 1.0986 .
Adjusted for this gain in SF by multiplying after rate conversion by 1/1.0986 = 0.9102
(Note, mouse scroll wheel on slider in SF volume adjustment gives you finer adjustment).
The anti-aliasing option was not used.

Another HRTF source, Earlab/ CIPIC from UC Davis, link below is from Boston U., same data:
http://earlab.bu.edu/databases/collections/cipic/Default.aspx

CIPIC coeffs appear to be uncompensated, they are very harsh.

Logitech Notes - it appears that with their Dolby mode off, they don't process any input to their sub channel.
Their sub channel appears to have special bass treatment.
