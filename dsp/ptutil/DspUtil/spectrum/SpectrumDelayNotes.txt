With targeted buffer size set to 40ms, spectral update set to 40 ms


WMP RESULTS
On Win XP with built in Dell sound card or DFX Adapter, with 128/320kpbs mp3 and .wav files,
0.93 secs is a good spectral delay setting.

On Vista 32 machine with built in sound card or DFX Adapter, 0.20 secs is a good setting.


WINAMP RESULTS
Winamp 5.541 on XP, with .mp3 and .wav 1.9 seconds delay was good.
This was using the default NullSoft DirectSound Output output plug-in, with default
buffering setting of 2000ms.

This setting also worked well with the NullSoft WaveOut output plug-in with default
buffer setting of 2000ms.

The same results were obtained on the Vista machine.
